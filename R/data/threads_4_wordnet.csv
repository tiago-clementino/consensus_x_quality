You have the right idea on the theory of ice bath: reduced inflammation, increased constriction, followed by increased flow to the tissues (called reactive hyperemia:  when the circulation is slowed or cut off to an area the blood then returns afterwards at a higher rate to flush out waste products and deliver nutrients).  You are also accurate in your discussion of the mixed results.  Despite the fact that some athletes and coaches swear by it, there is no consistent data that suggests that it is better than other (less painful) cool downs - such as a light active cool down.  IF you have an actual injury than the reduction in inflammation can be beneficial, but you'd could also achieve that with a more localized application of cold.  Having said that though, there are a lot of things out there that seem to work for individuals that are hard to support with scientific data - meaning when you combine a group together, the positive, neutral and negative responders cancel each other out. I'm not great in the cold, so I personally would not suffer through it for the degree of benefit that has been indicated. But, if you think it is working for you, I wouldn't stop doing it either. Sorry if that sounds wishy washy, but sometimes in physiology the individual response is the most important. You will find that is true for altitude training as well.  It seems to work for some, but not others (although in that case we have a slightly better idea of why...).  If you are a positive responder then altitude training can give you that 2% benefit you need. If you are not, it could actually make you worse. Keep up the great discussions.

My personal experience is that they stiffen me up. I prefer to cooldown and then at night before bed to have a very hot bath with epsom  salts (magnesium salts) to help muscle recovery.

So we would talk about types of climbing (bouldering, top rope climbing, lead climbing, and so on) and then test them on their knowledge. Afterward, we (the instructors) concluded we had failed miserably.So, in the second class we made a little newsletter in advance to talk about the adventure of climbing. We told little stories that only referred to these types of climbing to prime the pump.'''' Then when we introduced the instructors on the day of the class, we had each instructor tell a little about their background and a 30-second personal story that featured one of those types of climbing. Later we asked the scouts about the types of climbing. They all knew everything required for the merit badge and enthusiastically volunteered their knowledge - all without a formal lesson.It's a powerful tool, but I suspect many people think we outgrow its utility. People seem to think that serious subjects seems to demand serious lectures. Kudos to you for taking the challenge and spending the time to integrate stories in your teaching - both Cory's story each week and in the experiential interviews.

My first attempt was to download and run the installer, which proposed to install R 2.x on my system. As I already have R 3.01 and RStudio installed, I did not want to install R 2.x in place of or along side my working R setup. Therefore I cancelled this installation. I was able to use this command in R install.packages(c(JGR'''',''''Deducer'''',''''DeducerExtras''''))to install the R package, but I could not get Deducer to run from within R using these commands (either from RStudio or R's own GUI)library(JGR)JGR()Finally, I got JGR to run in a command box by making edits to jgrlaunch.batNot easy, but it seems to work. When I tried to open CSV files in what is now called the Data Table Editor, I found that all my data appeared in only two columns, an ID column generated by R and then all of my data appears on the 2nd column.  When I open the same file in Excel, all of my data is in separate columns, as it should be. At this point, I'm ready to give up on Deducer.

But for whatever reason, these researchers only wanted to know prevalence in white vs. not white.  Perhaps it was so they could do a simple odds ratio instead of a multi-level odds ratio.  So, even though Race is not really a binary variable, it is for the purposes of this study and that's how the researchers set it up.  In other words, they only recorded white vs. not white, so it is binary.  If they recorded black vs. not black, that would be binary.  If they recorded Asian vs. not Asian, that would be binary.  If they set it up as a multi-category variable with several races, then it would no longer be binary, but categorical instead.  It just depends on how they setup the data collection categories.Another example might be if they were studying diabetes in the Americas and the choices were North America - Yes or No, then that would be binary.

Generalized linear'''' because the outcome in your case is apparently dichotomous, or maybe polytomous (hence the ''''logistic'''' part and the ORs as results). The ''''mixed'''' part is to account for the correlation in the data, since they come from repeated measures on the same patients (the study is ''''longitudinal''''). The whole ''''mixed models'''' stuff has been a hot topic in biostats for at least a decade now. Its conception goes way back in time of course, but with software advances its use is now beginning to spread in clinical journals. It allows a lot more flexibility than traditional methods, so be prepared to see a *lot* more of those models in the near future. This is certainly so for ''''linear mixed models'''' for continuous outcomes, but I guess their ''''generalized'''' cousins for other types of outcomes are making progress fast. Needless to say, one must know how to handle this stuff, and I'm not sure what ''''guarantees'''' a reviewer should ask to ensure proper use. It's a topic worth of some on-line search!Now, regarding the small values of the coefficients, this is probably due to the tiny units of measurement (*micromoles*, right?), as Kristin has pointed above. Remember that a regression coefficient reflects changes for a *unit* difference in the corresponding predictor.The gem of the posts, of course, is the apparent CI/p-value discrepancy for regression-estimated odds ratios. This is something that has happened to me when running standard logistic regression (not the ''''mixed'''' variety that you mention). I was also incredulous at first, until some search showed that they are calculated using different approximations! I'd think that something similar applies in this case also. For more details, see for example this link, I think you will find it enlightening:http://www.epietalum.net/content/p0001-ci-085-731-or-how-can-confidence-interval-risk-ratio-include-1-if-p-value-0001So, my message is this: cheer up, all hope is not lost!''''",1,106,Medicine,Medicine/HRP258/Statistics_in_Medicine,Comment,FALSE,FALSE,"{51d07c79ae53040e0000002a=0.013587338215921136, 51d0825eae53040e0000002d=0.012471703657810217, 51d08f5dae53040e00000031=0.02116846869798237, 51d62c2cb1e6360e00000014=0.02280222346839406, 520fdd2cb2c4e6120000002b=0.0107874498276077}",more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion,0,1,51d62c2cb1e6360e00000014,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

This course has helped me to understand more precisely what they are now, and that has helped brilliantly. However, these days we need to be very careful when reviewing data submitted in artciles and checking that conclusions made from the analysis are logical and supported by the data themselves. All too often we get articles which draw conclusions which are not supported by the analysis, or in which half of the blatently obvious implications are overlooked/ignored/manipulated in phraseology (similar to the Vioxx study). My chief seems to have forgotten his statistical knowledge, e.g. when I point out columns in chart data with very overlapping SD bars which are marked as significant, he is not always as concerned as I am. And I am not always so confident of what my instinct/knowledge tells me. So I worry. I worry something will slip through that I should have spotted. Another example, I have pointed out linear regression plots with 'significant correlation' which clearly have two subpopulations of data (ie data points grouped into two, non-overlapping 'clouds' which the authors have not mentioned or concerned themselves with.Today I have an odds ratio of 0.9997 with a 95% CI of 0.9996-1.0001, which is marked as having a p-value of 0.0004. Is that logical? I have seen (but not yet studied) the video on p-values and (not)comparing them. I don't usually compare them. This one is not a comparison as such, just it struck me as being rather high for an OR well within the CI. I think perhaps I haven't understood the concept of having a siginificant OR that lies within the CI. I think my understanding was that if the OR is within the CI then there is 95% chance it is not significantly different from 1. Is that not the case? I've always considered my stats grounding good, but ORs/HRs etc were not in the scope of what I did. Should I be worried about this OR?If not when should I consider an OR as possibly being suspect?Sorry for the length of my post.

Are we supposed to look at only composite results for both? Do we only look at DHA or DHA and AA? Do we look at both breastfeeding sets of scores? If I knew or could help I would. You won't be revealing anything crucial to the outcome. People will still need to make computations and then make a decision.I'm not sure why, but there is excessive concern about revealing anything on these forums. If I was taking the test in a class room with the Professor, I could ask her this question and I'm pretty sure she would clarify.I've worked out all of the percent changes, for every pair of $eta$ values. I've computed averages of various groups of results including and average for the total of changes in each group. The issue is not how to do any of the computations or how to determoine an answer if I had a single pair of $eta$ values. It's just: What results are we supposed to be considering. The description is somewhat ambiguous.We get two types of answers to these types of questions. The condecending version: I think it's clear if you just think about it.'''' and the condescending that includes a treasure map: ''''I think it will be clear if you rewatch video A, B, and C.''''There is a difference between giving somebody the solution: ''''Use 27.3 as your result''''. And helping with understanding the wording or point of a question. It's even OK to tell somebody what video A, B, or C actually said.The level of reluctance to sharing understanding keeps reminding me of the federal government abusing the idea of making documents ''''secret''''. Often it is unneccessary and doesn't help.The wording refers only to ''''feeding method'''' which suggests we look at the results for both groups in table 2, while she explicitly says ''''DHA concentration'''' which suggests we only look at one group in table 2. Those statements suggest we compare 12 pairs of $eta$ values in table 2 to 6 pairs of $eta$ values in table 3. In addition, what the heck does Composite mean? I've hunted and can't find it. If that's the only pairs we should consider, which has been suggested by questions, then we compare both composite pairs in table 2 to one pair in table 3? Furthermore, if you look at the results for all pairs in one table to all pairs in the other, results are not consistent.

When a paper says ''''The data were analysed...'''' readers will surely understand that to mean ''''The researchers analysed the data...'''' unless it is specified otherwise.''''Unfortunately, that ambiguity can be exploited. Ghostwriting is a significant problem in the medical literature. ([http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/sep/18/bad-science-medical-ghostwriters][1]) It is not an overstatement to say that lives have been lost because of it. Of course switching to the active voice will not solve the problem, but we should do whatever we can to promote transparency.Rather than ask whether my writing is sufficiently clear and accurate for a specific audience, I ask whether it is as clear and accurate as possible. The following quote (widely attributed to Einstein) was used in a course I attended on Science Communication. I keep it in mind whenever writing about a technical subject.> Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.([Quote Investigator][2])If writing for my peers rather than the general public, I might include different content rather than adopt a different writing style: for instance I may omit certain long-form explanations, whilst making sure there is enough information there for someone with incomplete background knowledge to look up the explanation elsewhere if they want. As already mentioned, not everyone with an interest in the scientific literature comes from a scientific background. Think about the rise of open access publishing and the fact that even traditional publishers  - quite rightly - have schemes in place to allow patients and their representatives free access to relevant papers. Do not underestimate the lengths that ''''lay'''' people will go to in order to better understand their own or a loved one's medical condition. That really would be patronizing.  [1]: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/sep/18/bad-science-medical-ghostwriters  [2]: http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/''''",0,132,Medicine,Medicine/SciWrite/Fall2013,Comment,FALSE,FALSE,"{52529fa83d52a13ac200000c=0.18191798247476454, 5252e4b1371ff11210000015=0.1777405730139679, 52531051f6575e1c96000028=0.18512113996954055, 52531fe23d52a13c67000021=0.18130798317678146, 52540eb64e261bd2db000018=0.09963497305533454, 525d31866cd1ea5204000003=0.021311796214483546, 526862ee03a332dacf000014=0.1786184694116067}",more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion,1,4,525d31866cd1ea5204000003,1,7,0,0,0,0.25,1,0,0,0,0

If one is not permitted to assume specialist knowledge then need every article explain from first principles? Clearly this is not the case. If we were to pursue this line too far is there not a danger that, by attempting to make material accessible to the general reader, something may be lost to the specialist who was the primary intended audience? I'm certainly not suggesting, as Amy comments above, that one should *use overly complex language for the sake of appearing intelligent* nor that papers should not be clearly written. I would argue, however, that stylistic issues such as the use of the passive voice need not be associated with such traits.> I want to make sure the specialized material I work with is available> to the general reader, not just the specialistAn admirable aim (which also has commercial merit) echoing Raleen's wish to include non-specialist readers in the 'discussion' but can this ambition not sometimes conflict with the desire for brevity and clarity? While one may deplore the use of unnecessary jargon, every specialist area has a common vocabulary which, at least in part, serves the laudable end of avoiding not only re-inventing the wheel but also describing in detail the process of doing so. I asked, slightly facetiously, in another post, whether as an educator writing for colleagues I should avoid referring to *formative assessment* and instead always refer to *things done, that do not form part of the final grading, to judge progress towards a target in order to provide feedback of a nature intended to stimulate in the student self-reflective improvement in performance*? It could certainly be argued that the phrase is not in general currency outside education so should we include a glossary or footnote for the benefit of general readers or simply avoid the use of such specialist vocabulary entirely? Conversely, to use the phrase 'formative assessment'when speaking to parents (or students) without explaining the term, as I have witnessed far too frequently, would constitute a most egregious use of jargon. Similarly, if writing specifically for a general audience any unavoidable specialist vocabulary should be explained on first encounter and failure to do so would betr",0,132,Medicine,Medicine/SciWrite/Fall2013,Comment,FALSE,FALSE,"{52529fa83d52a13ac200000c=0.025222283641367044, 5252e4b1371ff11210000015=0.017382341298472027, 52531051f6575e1c96000028=0.02835084164488354, 52531fe23d52a13c67000021=0.024551083290171322, 52540eb64e261bd2db000018=0.10122804371980061, 525d31866cd1ea5204000003=0.18130798317678126, 526862ee03a332dacf000014=0.01940081258967433}",more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion,1,4,525d31866cd1ea5204000003,1,7,0,0,0,0.25,1,0,0,0,0

If I am writing for my younger students it is entirely appropriate to use simple structures and to explain specialist vocabulary before using it (the teaching of the correct use of specialist language is one of the core requirements for all subject teachers in England). My older students would be expected both to understand and use more complex and nuanced language forms.When writing for a specialised audience of fellow professionals, are we really to conclude that our readers' interest is so transitory that the lack of 'spunky' active verbs will deter them from reading a paper? Are our peers so naive as to be unable to distinguish that the passive voice implicitly indicates the authors as subjects? When a paper says The data were analysed...'''' readers will surely understand that to mean ''''The researchers analysed the data...'''' unless it is specified otherwise.When writing for a general audience the language needs to be simplified and any specialist terms explained. Non-specialist readers of a wide circulation publication may have only a passing interest in an article and so it would be entirely appropriate to use an active voice in the first person in order to capture and maintain their attention. Whether the same does, or should, apply to readers of academic publications is, in my view, another matter. I don't feel I need my hand held and sweeties held out to persuade me to read a paper if it is relevant to my interests or needs. I just want the content to be clearly and succinctly expressed and, again, in my opinion, that can be accomplished at least as well in the passive voice as the active.Sorry for a rather long post which probably makes me look like something of a linguistic conservative, not to say dinosaur.

If plagiarism is suspected, the reviewer should give a reference.4. Display the final grade total before submission, so that the reviewer can check their individual 1s, 2s, 3s add up to the overall grade they want to give.5. Where there is a choice, the writer should state which assignment they are doing as this is not always clear.6. If an essay is flagged, could a flag icon appear by Assessment Panel'''' (similar to the exclamation mark that appeared before peer reviews were completed)?7.

Like you I'm happy with the overall gradings but editing often leaves me baffled. My lowest score on essay 3 was 10 - this reviewer added a 3 work edit and commented 'too much words'! If this was really their only problem with my work  then surely more effort should have been put in to providing revisions. People have a tendency to want to get their own results and know this can only happen if they get through the reviews so they want it over and done with. We are therefore reliant on the integrity of participants - I don't know the answer to making everyone do it correctly but perhaps looking at alternative ways might help - this time I edited externally and pasted my reviewed version into the system (downside- no standard mark-ups but comments for each of the participants, a virtual re-write for 2 and substantial edits throughout all 4 and avoiding all the system bugs meant it took much less time and no marking changes!). It would be nice if there were some type of checking system that related score to editing - a score of 15 requiring none or little but more and more edits required as the score reduces (a percentage of the initial word count perhaps?). I realise this is probably way beyond this type of system and won't eliminate 'ksudhgra:ksdbv:aergu' type edits but so many people have been frustrated by this process that I believe it needs to be addressed before the course is offered again. A reviewer feedback system would be useful too even if it was as simple as - I find this review helpful/unhelpful/unnecessary -at least then, the reviewer gets some feedback on their work and the reviewee (is that a word?) may feel better by being able to comment directly.Although of concern to all, those who are genuinely at the lower end of the ability range need the most feedback on this type of task in order that they can improve their writing skills.

This post is NOT to complain for the grades (that are quite high, so I'm really satisfied with them), but to open a discussion about the usefulness of the grading systems as it is at the moment.For writing assignment 2, I submitted the introduction of a paper I am drafting. The peer grading were the following:GRADER 1 --> 15/15, no comments or corrections on the essay GRADER 2 --> 13/15, no comments or corrections on the essay GRADER 3 --> 13/15, no comments or corrections on the essay I decided to resubmit the same essay for writing assignment 3 (in the hope of receiving some usefull suggestions/comments): I edited it a little bit, but I couldn't do much becasue I had no feedback from the first 3 reviewers. Some minutes ago I got the peer grading for assignament 3:GRADER 4 --> 15/15, no comments or corrections on the essay GRADER 5 --> 13/15, no comments or corrections on the essay GRADER 6 --> 10/15, no comments or corrections on the essay (and this one really made me angry: he/she graded the essay as boring, non-compelling, confused, inconsistent, full of clutter...and left NO comment ?!?!?!?!?)So, the point is that my essay was reviewer by 6 different people, got grades ranging from 10 (indicating a rather poor quality of writing) to 15 (perfection), and NO ONE gave me a single suggestion about how to improve it. So, in the end, I don't know the real quality of my writing, and I've got no feedback about how to improve it. This makes me think that the peer-grading system in this course is completely useless and is not a learning tool. What I think is that some (the majority of?) reviewers doesn't even care to read the essay, they just click on the scores - although I must admit that I've been lucky: at least my reviewers were just lazy, but didn't gave me dramatically low scores! But how canwe learn how to improve our writing skills from this experience?",4,267,Medicine,Medicine/SciWrite/Fall2013,CommentThread,FALSE,FALSE,"{5284c7dfef3aac5734000001=0.021103740886948066, 5284cf2aef3aacc649000002=0.015122191935882826, 5284cf983623f98872000003=0.010907226278675354, 5284d1da3623f9d6fb000003=0.1060553907736608, 5284d512ef3aacc649000004=0.10043819362370904, 52852e2e2d0e3beb8a00000c=0.10141831702946877, 5285458ab3c4e2312900000c=0.18208388796210967, 5285ad8aef3aace4b5000017=0.09892329984312549, 5285ee2b2d0e3bc30700000c=0.02137337555732931}",more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion,0,2,5285458ab3c4e2312900000c,1,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

It was part of the physical activity, disease and aging section, but was moved out to its own section because the original lecture was getting too long.  The bottom line is that infections go up in the winter because of the short, cold, dry days which help viruses survive and the reduction in Vit D formed in the skin by the sun. Also, everyone is stuck together inside spreading germs.  There seems to be mixed data on whether cold increases risk of infection.  That idea was ''''debugged'''' some time ago, but some more recent evidence suggests that maybe the cold,dry air irritates the ventilatory passages of athletes training outdoors which make them more susceptible to infections.

So know your confusion is in good company. Lets see if I can be helpful. The main point is this: **it requires the same amount of oxygen for your body to do a certain amount of work.** If that work is below the maximal capacity, we call it a submax workload. For example, I did a few months of cycling training to increase my aerobic fitness a year or so back as a part of a previous teaching project. We tested my VO2max by doing a progressive (increasing workload every few minutes) test on a stationary bike where I wore a mask that measured the oxygen I was using at Week 0, Week 5, and Week 10 of my training regimen. My VO2max increased across my 10 week training program because my body had optimized components of the fick equation, meaning that I could finish the test at a later stage where I cycled at higher watts of resistance. Lets say at Week 0 my maximum resistance at the end of the test was 250 watts, but at Week 10 it was 350 watts. Because of my training, I was becoming a better cyclist! Here is the point. Regardless of my training and assuming my cycling technique didn't change, at 150 watts (a light, submaximal workload), my body needed to consume the same amount of oxygen at Week 0 Week 5 and Week 10 to do 150 watts of work. The difference is, at the end of the training, my body could consume more oxygen, and 150 watts of a submaximal workload was easier because it was a lower percentage of my overall VO2max. -Staff",1,115,Humanities,HumanitiesSciences/EP101/Environmental_Physiology,Comment,FALSE,FALSE,{52da9f719e322a6881000009=0.1804889607814864},first opinion is not the first comment,1,2,52da9f719e322a6881000009,1,4,0,0,0,0.5,0,1,1,1,1

I got suspicious because in the meanwhile I could not browse and then I logged on to the site from my mobile phone and could see that my answers were actually not saved because there was some communication error between my Modem and LAN card on my desktop whereas  my wifi was working .Thus if we have some problem either with the net connection or local computer we can easily think we have saved a lot of our work whereas it may not be so.At least with the individual save and check buttons for every answer we can get to know that our answer is not saved compared to the en-masse save button.

You will end up with six products representing total breaths for each of the six breath outcomes.  For example, the outcome of 11 breaths occurs 10 times.  That's a total breath count of 110 breaths for those 10 people.  Do the same for the other 5 outcome values and their associated frequencies.  Now, add up the six products to get total breaths.  Then, divide that total by 60 to get the average breath count per person. That is your mean.To get the **standard deviation**, calculate the difference between a given breath outcome and your calculated mean (for example: 11 â calculated mean).  Now, square that difference and multiply it by the frequency for that outcome.  The general formula for any given outcome (i) for this first part is: ((outcome(i) â calculated mean)^2) * frequency(i).  In our example: ((11 â calculated mean) ^2) * 10.  That provides the total squared deviations for a single outcome.  Do the same for the other 5 outcome values using your calculated mean and the associated frequency for each outcome.  Now, add up those six total squared deviations to get the grand total squared deviation (GTSD).  Divide that number by n-1 (60-1).  Now, take the square root to get the standard deviation.  So the standard deviation = sqrt(GTSD/(n-1)).The **median** will be the average of two data points in the middle since n is even (60 data points).  So, the median will be the average of points 30 and 31.  What values are at points 30 and 31?  To calculate the IQR, you need the 25th and 75th percentiles.  The **25th percentile** will be the median of the lower 30 data points (1-30).  Again, since the count of the lower 30 points is even, the median will be the average of the two data points in the middle of points 1-30, which will be points 15 & 16.  What values are at points 15 & 16?  The **75th percentile** will be the median of the upper 30 data points (31-60).  Again, since the count of the upper 30 points is even, the median will be the average of the two data points in the middle of points 31-60, which wil",6,289,Medicine,Medicine/HRP258/Statistics_in_Medicine,CommentThread,FALSE,FALSE,{51bb42c45e980e0e00000024=0.027444932082930404},NA,0,1,51bb42c45e980e0e00000024,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1

I got even more confused when I realized I had the correct Z value, but the answers were still wrong.I tried using the calculator given in the link, but I kept getting funny error messages and no answers, so I used the Math Is Fun chart instead.  What I didn't realize is that the chart on Math Is Fun has different values than the charts in the lectures.  I even read the intro sentence to the chart which said, The table shows the area from 0 to Z.''''  Apparently this 0 is not the same ''''zero'''' as I expected.  I assumed they meant the zero that is located at the y-axis line.  Instead, this 0 is the mean.  If I was warned that this chart displayed its information differently than the chart in the lectures, then I would have gotten questions 3 and 4 correct.  I answered 43 women (as opposed to 7) because that's what the chart seemed to be telling me.  And 100-43=57 women made even less sense, since I knew the answer had to be less than 50%.  I was very confused with these two problems, but had to submit my homework anyway since time was running out.I guess what I'm asking is if questions 3 and 4 could be not counted for the grade.  And in future iterations of this course, please, just add a jpeg of the chart (from the lectures) in the homework.  Or, if you absolutely have to link to the Math Is Fun chart, please first explain how, unlike the lectures, the chart shows the area from the mean to Z, as opposed to from Z to zero as in the lectures (and how their statement ''''from 0 to Z'''' really means ''''from mean to Z'''').Not that I'm upset. :)  Maybe a wee bit irked, is all.  It sounds like this is the first time this course material is being offered, so I can understand that there will be little complications like this.  Overall, I adore this course.  It is the sole reason I signed up for a MOOC for the first time in my life.  I couldn't find detailed information about statistics in, specifically, medical studies in all the many places I looked.

There's a section in the article that discusses specific statistical analyses that we've been presented with the past couple of weeks.The proteins that the team identified have a wide variety of roles. STIP1 influences the creation of new neurons, for example, while cypin affects the number of branches they have. CRMP1 and CRMP2 stop neurons from growing and determine their length. YBX1 is involved in gene transcription, as well as neural migration during development. Finally, LDH is the most mysterious of the sextet but is also the most strongly linked to autism. Earlier studies suggest that it may play a role in metabolism or in responses to viruses or toxins.All six are highly expressed in the fetal brain. Of 246 mothers with children living with autism, 2<zipRedac> percent had antibodies that recognized two or more of these proteins, compared to just 1 percent of 149 mothers with normally developing children. The antibodies have more than 99 percent specificity for autism risk, which means that they have less than a 1 in a 100 chance of finding a false positive.''''http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/<zipRedac>6<zipRedac>79/title/Maternal-Antibodies-Linked-to-Autism/If you're interested in reading more, the two papers recently published on the work are cited at the bottom of the article.

A small effect size when applied to millions in the population may prove important.

Our own responses to mistakes, frustration, and feelings that we don't get it'''' (especially around procedural fluency issues like how to navigate a user interface) have the potential to help us understand some of the causes of our students' difficulties.Prof. Boaler, if you're reading this, please know that I realize this course is a prototype and am glad to be a part of it!  At the same time, I can't resist the opportunity for learning that this represents.  **1 -- Percentage Anxiety**.  When the ''''Progress'''' tab showed 0% (apparently for everyone), many people seemed to assume that they had done something wrong.  Is this related to the ways that students assume their answer is ''''wrong'''' if it's not what's in the back of the book?  **2 -- The Default Blame Setting**.  Why might some people assume that they were wrong, while others assumed that the tool was wrong?   Is this connected to the idea, in math class, of estimating ''''plausible'''' answers, so that if your answer is outside that range, you suspect an error?  Do students apply the same ''''sanity check'''' to answers they get from the back of the book, or from a calculator, or from a teacher, or from a computer?  If so, how did they learn to question those ''''authorities''''?  If they use sanity checks on their own work but not on answers from other sources, why not?  If they don't use sanity checks at all, why is that?**3 -- Amplification.** MOOCs give us the possibility of reaching huge groups of students at one time, potentially with research-based teaching methods and assessment carefully designed for high consequential validity.  Unfortunately, the platform amplifies *everything*, not just our careful design.  The everyday glitches that normally throw off 30 students can now throw off hundreds or thousands at a time (see above for causes of anxiety, fear, discomfort).If I accidentally do something that worsens the quality of classroom culture, I have 20 people with whom my relationship has gotten a tiny bit weaker.  20 people with whom I now set about re-strengthening that relationship.  I know each of them, have multiple kinds of feedback (body language, tone of voice, content of classroom participant, frequency of classroom participation, etc.), I know what will reassure them, I know physically where they'll be, and I know when one is missing.  In a MOOC, people who are alienated can disappear without a trace (it's n''''",4,49,Education,Education/EDUC115N/How_to_Learn_Math,CommentThread,FALSE,FALSE,"{51e61155e339d716000002eb=0.014212062389835373, 51e6cd2ea5474f1200000059=0.09439950254831071, 51e99d66a1e51a12000000c6=0.1760100855280467}",more than one opinion / more than one opinion,0,2,51e99d66a1e51a12000000c6,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1

Instead of testing knowledge of concepts, it often seems to be testing math skills...Dr. Sainini remarks often about but you won't need to calculate this, you'll have statistics software that does this''''...but then on the homework instead of being asked to interpret data we do rote calculations. I think the most egregious sample of this so far is the Homework 7. Every lecture, before she showed the methodology, she repeatedly stated ''''But you won't have to calculate this, this is what the software will do for you'''', yet a very substantial portion of the homework is performing calculations that according to her our software should be doing for us.

In a Finance course on Coursera that I took, they had an Assignments'''' category among several other basic super-categories. When you selected ''''Assignments'''' you were now faced with a category for each week's assignment, ''''Assignment 1'''' , ''''Assignment 2'''' , and so on. When you selected the Assignment you were interested in, you then had two choices: ''''Questions 1 - 5'''' and ''''Questions 6 - 10''''.

You could very quickly (the server and content worked and loaded quickly) get where you wanted, either to post or read. If you did not uncheck the ''''subscribe'''' check box when you posted on a thread (I always subscribed, at least initially) you recieved an email with the content of any post in that thread, with a link that took you to the post.I spent way too much time reading and responding to posts due to the ease of use and the lack of tedious waiting (as I experience on the edx forums). I have felt for some time that if you could take the care and structure of the content of classes on edx, and marry that to the forum structure and design of the Coursera forums well . . . that dog could hunt!

What I am exciting about in statistics is the fact that you cannot be absolutely sure about anything â however, this is also the reason why it can be so irritating sometimes :-) The fact about hypothesis testing is that neither hypothesis is âtrueâ. After a test, you end up with a p-value that must be explained. The idea is to keep âsignificance levelâ low and âpowerâ high, and yes, in the most cases, we try to formulate our hypothesis in such way that we âgoâ after âthe alternative oneâ. However most importantly is to formulate the null hypothesis based on a clear probability model â something you can calculate with â otherwise it makes no sense at all. Anyway, I am still puzzled about the way we can explain p-values. Yes, if a p-value is 0.5, this means we cannot reject null hypothesis. But do we have any other indication? Or may we use the results from the test in order to formulate our next step? Is that a kind of âbiasâ? I think I need to research the subject more deeply:-).

(Let me cite the relevant text, where the case of two, rather than one, particular significant values is discussed: ''...these two significant p-values likely reflect chance findings rather than true effects''.)This is bothering me. Let me try to explain why. I can only see one plausible interpretation of the claim that the significant result in question is ''most likely a chance finding''. This interpretation is the following'The significant result is most likely a chance finding' means that we would have expected, prior to gathering the data, to obtain significant data on this particular test by chance alone, i.e. even on the assumption that $H$ is true.Now of course, as we all know, in a battery of 50 independent tests, the probability, conditional on $H$, of obtaining at least one result with a p-value lower than .05 is fairly high. Indeed, it is equal to $1 - 0.95^{50}$, which is roughly 0.92. But this, true as it may be, does *not* entail that the probability of obtaining significant data *on this particular test*, i.e. on the test for $H_1$, is high, conditional on $H$. Indeed, it is as low as it would have been in the absence of all the remaining tests, namely 0.05. In other words: although it is correct to say that one should have expected to obtain a significant value for at least one statistic by chance alone, it is simply *incorrect* to say of any particular statistic that one should have expected it to have a significant value by chance alone.''''",1,140,Medicine,Medicine/HRP258/Statistics_in_Medicine,CommentThread,FALSE,FALSE,"{52029fccb65d7d12000000ae=0.02245269984606392, 5203c1393ea6940e00000085=0.01794084222287258}",more than one opinion,1,1,52029fccb65d7d12000000ae,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

In fact, I am so convinced of the utility of this course that I feel that this course should be made mandatory to anyone working in the field of medicine especially diagnostics.Thanks for making statistics interesting.<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>",4,188,Medicine,Medicine/HRP258/Statistics_in_Medicine,Comment,FALSE,FALSE,"{5208396a508b3c0e0000004d=0.02696410306011038, 5209529a7ad0490e00000039=0.02709661585032865, 520a76f484e4c61600000063=0.33842211316244225}",more than one opinion / more than one opinion,0,1,520a76f484e4c61600000063,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1

In other words our posterior belief given the study did not change. We have no new information. Second of all we do not have sufficient information to verify second assertion that the reason of not finding of statistically significant association was insufficient sample size. It could have been just a lack of causality. The findings in the study could be just chance findings for all we know.Perhaps I am reading into question too much. But you have to do it to answer other questions. The point is you still have to make certain assumptions about each choice to come up with the answer.

But, at the same time, it's important not to perpetuate misconceptions with the use of too vague terms, especially among the lay people who tend to get easily confused exactly because they are lay people (or even people from tangent fields).

The author's use the word *re-infusion*, which only appears in the 2nd clause, avoids the need to introduce the lymphocytes' origins--their origin is implicit. *Re-infusion''''* informs the reader that lymphocytes were extracted from a host--they had to come from somewhere!--only to be re-infused back into the same (autologous) tumor-bearing host. This phrasing, or *selective vagueness*, allowed the lymphocytes to almost appear out of thin air! 2. When I rewrote the sentence, replacing the -ion nouns with verbs, the sentence's context forced me to choose the lesser of two evils: either use my new-found spunky verbs in the passive voice or explain who (or what) selects, activates, and expands the lymphocytes. For each verb there are many possible subjects: including this information would eliminate the succinctness of the summary of the lymphocytes involvement in adoptive cell transfer (ACT).Despite the predicament of (2), I like the new sentence with verbs.

Yours sounds good!Mine is below:Immortality is alluring. Some scientists believe the first step to possibly âupload a mindâ is to recreate brain circuits in silico. Reverse engineering could create the initial circuit map.Electron microscopes visualise neural processes and map circuitry. Focused ion-beam scanning electron microscopes (Knott et al. 2008) deliver quality images but their sample size limit is vulnerable to damage. Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy is a new method that (SBEM: Denk and Horstmann 2004) directly images the block-face and accommodates larger tissues. Dr. Kevin Briggman and associates (Briggman, Helmstaedter, and Denk 2011) recently used SBEM in the mouse retina to map connections between starburst amacrine cells and direction-selective bipolar ganglion cells. An extracellular stain was applied to a 200-micron retina piece containing a starburst amacrine cell with the arborization field. Their map clarified the cellular circuit and identified putative synapses. The intracellular synaptic features were unobservable with the initial stain and a second sample was stained to show these. The results with the initial and second sample stains were correlated.  The findings reveal the directionally-selective wiring of starburst amacrine cells.  Future directions include to prepare (Mikula, Binding, and Denk 2012) and map the mouse brain with SBEM.

On October 18, 2013 New York Times health and science reporter Gina Kolata wrote about Aronowitzâs articles and the underlying study in âDecades Later, Condemnation For a Skid Row Cancer Study.â  The study subjects--skid row alcoholics--were offered room and board for a short stay if they allowed the researchers to perform prostate biopsies âin a very interesting part of their anatomy.â (Kolata, A3)  If found to be positive, those subjects were provided free medical followup.  Weaving together interviews, assessments by medical historians and analyses of the original Aronowitz articles, Kolata wrote a devastating critique of the project and practically all involved in it.  This essay will scrutinize her critique and will examine how she dealt with the more consequential issues implicit in the study and others like it. [Fn. not pasteable from Word.]Perry Hudson, M.D. was a young medical researcher at Columbia University in the 1950s.  He wanted to show that prostate cancer could be detected early on, treated and cured, and as Kolata notes âa laudable goalâ (Kolata, A3), except that Hudson chose âskid rowâ alcoholics to be his subjects and his methodology incorporated invasive biopsiesâa scenario made worse by Hudsonâs lack of full disclosure.  He picked men from Bowery flophouses , homeless, penniless men who were often mentally ill alcoholics unlikely to understand what was involved: and who, even if aware, were powerless to do much about it.  Administrators ensured the âvolunteersââ continued attendance in the program by withholding their meal tickets.  (Kolata)Hudson screened subjects via invasive biopsy: surgical incision was the accepted  protocol then.  At that time, prostate cancer was more often than not a death sentence.  If detected, it was discovered late, after metastasis, and usually fatal.   Hudson warned only of possible infection, when other serious complications often did occur:  including rectal complications, impotency and diminished sexual functioning.

I hit return as I jumped up to help, remembering too late that I had forgotten to score it numerically. I am so sorry -- with the way the system is randomly entering scores the writer could receive any score or it may just throw out my grades and suggested edits.A few thoughts on how to improve the system:1) Ensure that the system does not randomly assign scores.  (This is continuing to happen on the second assignment.  I read, score, edit, then rethink/recheck my scores.  Usually the scores have been reset to different numbers while I am editing.  I reenter scores and hit return, hoping for the best.)2) Make it possible for a grader to retrieve a paper within a certain timeframe so they can complete grading and editing if they submit it by mistake too soon. 3) Have the system refuse to accept a graded paper until it has checked that the grader has scored it.  Add a prompt -- did you forget to score? I'm not sure what happened to the paper I edited, but I hope that the writer does not receive all zeros along with a page of suggested edits!I have learned a lot from the peer editing process.

I have seen that one of the reviewers has graded my second assay in a weird way: 3 sections are graded with 0'''' and 2 are graded with ''''3''''. From the guides, 0 points (no score) means blank or incomplete essay, which is not the case. The assay is complete and even though it's not perfect I think it's not fair to get three ''''0'''' -specially when the other 2 reviewers are saying it is pretty good. I think that the last one didn't pay much attention when grading it and just selected the first thing that he saw.I would like to know if there is any way to report these cases so that they are not taken into account, because I don't think they're serious.Many thanks and thanks for organizing this great course.<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>''''",0,67,Medicine,Medicine/SciWrite/Fall2013,CommentThread,FALSE,FALSE,"{527b6ddb023e785b4c000005=0.02250011308808121, 527b6f8d82654fff4c000004=0.17632575722038268, 527ba6376436565aa4000009=0.2631821560195599, 527bba4f82654fff4c000012=0.2619276781156368, 5286c5ca44e736548b000015=0.09757456773558684}",more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion,0,1,527b6ddb023e785b4c000005,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1

I suspect that these are submitted by people rushing through peer grading to access their own grades quickly, perhaps to get a chance to resubmit sooner (and with less effort). Over two essays I have received two blank reviews and one that was very poor quality - largely grammatically incorrect and misspelled corrections that changed the meaning of sentences or rendered them nonsensical. I propose that after submitting peer reviews, the reviewer cannot see their own grades until the reviews they have given are verified (and they have to verify a number of other peer reviews). All this would involve is having a quick skim of the comments and ticking a box to say this review is fair''''. The additional workload would be minimal. A fair review would be one in which the grades in each section are justified in the reviewers comments - the checker does not necessarily have to agree with the score, they are really just making sure that the essay has been actually been reviewed and the grade is consistent with the comments. If comments are absent, nonsensical, or inconsistent with the grades (due to the reset problem), the review would be rejected and the reviewer would have to review another essay in order to progress.

It was as I expected it to be. The course title, Statistical Learning'''', and the book title, ''''An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R'''', led me to believe this was more of a statistical learning course than a course for learning R. Others seems concerned not enough R was presented, but I felt the course lived up to it's title and I learned some R programming to boot. Though, as a matter of course, I am a statistician who programs and not a programmer who uses statistics. Although, I have been taught many of these statistical methods previous, many I have not. It was great to have a thorough exposition of the many supervised statistical learning methods providing practical compare and contrast between them. I also enjoyed learning about cross-validation and the bootstrap methods of choosing best fit models and parameter estimation when it is otherwise unavailable. These methods suggest a different answer other than the traditional, ''''we need more samples''''. Throughout the course and text is discussed high dimensionality which I find very useful and that of prediction accuracy versus interpretable models. I have spent my career in R&D and have never had the luxury of any other than having to interpret the statistical results. In my field people viewed predictive models as always wrong and sometimes useful. It was nice to see the genomic examples of predictive usefulness. I will keep a look out for follow on courses to this one for data science.

Like him/her I have advanced degrees in a quantitative area (EE), and I've taken my share of Statistics courses. A little rusty, but that's easily fixed. However, I feel the prerequisites (first courses in statistics, linear algebra, and computing) understate the knowledge required (and the currency of that knowledge), and this statement This is not a math-heavy class, so we try and describe the methods without heavy reliance on formulas and complex mathematics'''' really hinges on one's definition of 'formulas and complex mathematics'. Again, all easily fix-able by me with some review of my prior studies.I think the guidance of 3 hours/week is not realistic in my case. Between the lectures and reading the book I'm easily at 5-6 hours, and that's before any quizzes. I think people who are at 3 hours/week or less are already very familiar with the material being covered, and/or flying at a higher level than me.My real interest is in learning enough to apply some of the techniques taught in this class to real-world business situations (I like JMichael's suggestion). I'll stick with the course for as long as I think I can get some of that though I have to say after lecture series 3, I'm feeling the direction is too academic: we'll see if that changes.''''",3,2486,Humanities,HumanitiesScience/StatLearning/Winter2014,Comment,FALSE,FALSE,"{52e591d8a8d51b089c00002f=0.10566937758994964, 52eb105175d9e5c5fc000004=0.02192660323186245, 52f189038a0e21cda100008c=0.09854015071693961, 52f9f0648314671ade000019=0.26082322130292224, 52fb90e6a78f4f362d000025=0.17934186464396007}",first opinion is not the first comment / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion,0,4,52f9f0648314671ade000019,0,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

So, with just doubling, 5s and 10s, you have 2, 4, 5, 8, 10 all done. Now, learn 3s and (with doubling) you have 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12s. 11s are easy with patterning and that just leaves a few 7s and 9s to memorize''''. I started my daughter off with 7 x 8, 7 x 9, 8 x 8, 6 x 9 and 7, 8, and 9 squared. The rest were easy once she had those down.

This supposed difference could occur because in language learning, the historical and artistic contexts are brought by the literature. Your suggestion of Lockhart's text fits like a glove on my interest in comparing language and math teaching.Thank you very much for the wonderful

The approach used is called guided discovery.  I think it makes a lot of sense and have used it in my class.  The JUMP website cites the following reports to back up this approach:> (Taken from website) J. Bisanz et al. (2010) Foundations for Numeracy: An Evidence-based> Toolkit for the Effective Mathematics Teacher. Canadian Child Care Federation and Canadian Language and Literacy Research Network, p. 44.> In 2011, L.

I have two classes where 20-25% of students have learning challenges. Circumstances range from minor speech to more pronounced processing difficulties. Although they are regularly pulled-out to work directly with a resource specialist, I insist that they take part in some group-think activities which gives them opportunities to share any thoughts with peers. I think the exposure to open-ended brainstorming activities is beneficial to their well-being, if not in their conceptual understanding. Is there evidence that addresses the latter- either positively or negatively for students with special needs? And any insight is appreciated.Jo, thanks for the course offering.

My nephew is meticulous (and I have other students too) he understands the concepts but very carefully writes each step with precise penmanship and computation.  He is painfully slow at completing an assignment, but the care with which he works has value (in some segments and careers).  It is not in the best interest of the students to promote mediocrity in favor of speed.  Furthermore, many students are intimidated by the time factor on tests which impacts their success.

singer or dancer (as these roles are currently defined!)''''",0,2357,Education,Education/EDUC115N/How_to_Learn_Math,Comment,FALSE,FALSE,"{521cdf96f25b381200000013=0.10671410144687886,

What I wonder is whether doing the discovering math approach only part way, not giving the entire class over to it, is at all useful? Or does doing each method halfway set the students back? Is there any evidence on the effect of implementing the type of math learning presented in this class just partway, or just once or twice a week for only part of the class?

Sometimes let kids work together at equal levels, and other times use mixed groups? This will allow the higher students to zoom out into the nether reaches while permitting the slower ones the time they need to refresh on the basics -- and it will also allow peer tutoring in the mixed groups (which is what usually ends up happening).To <redacted>: one way to avoid the quicker kids doing all the work is to begin with a lesson on How To Work In A Group, with a focus on Every Student Contributes Something. Also, I often have my students include along with their group papers some self/group evaluations where they rate not only how well the others did as team players but also how they themselves did!!

I completely agree about the importance of cultivating a growth mindset, and that a fixed mindset can be very damaging and stifle attempts at learning. The question that arises for me is around whether there are any limits to brain plasticity and learning, as it applies to maths? Have there been any attempts to identify a genetic component through, for example, twin studies? Is there any such thing as innate ability in this area, and how large a role does this play? Maybe it doesn't matter, in the sense that what we are trying to do as teachers, is to help everyone to reach their full mathematical potential, whatever that may

It seems that one way to make math classes more 'real world' and inquiry based would be to merge class time with other subjects.  Science is the obvious example, but with the amount of data and resources available online, other subjects could work, too.  For example, a history lesson could prompt students to figure out what the current world population (or part of it, ex. Jews in Poland, native Americans in the states that were original 13 colonies) would be today if a major historical event had not happened (war, disease, colonization).  A language arts class could analyze linguistic data, and make graphs to analyze trends in word use over time.So, the question is, how do you suggest math teachers reach across departmental boundaries and work with teachers in other subjects to make math relevant to the rest of academic work and

The distant blaring honks and motor sounds of the chaotic Delhi traffic gradually faded further as she continued to look ahead at the 17th century astronomical instruments trying to decipher the complexity of the concrete observatory tools. This was Mayaâs second visit to Delhi from her village Jharsa in Gurgaon located on the outskirts of Delhi. She was visiting her motherâs brother Gopal who was a lower division clerk in the state government. Although Gopalâs position in the government was among the lowest in the government machinery, he was a respected man in his village by virtue of his employment. Employment in the government was aspirational amongst the youth in Jharsa where he also grew up as a child. A government employment not only ensured secure employment and a regular monthly income but also a state pension on retirement. These privileges were also recognized by parents seeking suitable husbands for their daughters. A soft and gentle touch on her frail shoulder brought Maya back to the reality her mind had drifted from. She was pleasantly surprised to see a middle-aged foreign lady with a warm and friendly smile dressed in tight designer jeans and a Versace shirt standing by her side. Lisa had spent the entire morning on the lawns of the Jantar Mantar drawing sketches to take back to America. She was just about to return to her hotel after packing her things when Mayaâs motionless gaze caught her attention. Dr Lisa Randall, a theoretical physicist and Harvard Professor was visiting India as part of her Asia lecture series organized by the US â India Women in Science Society.  Lisa had taken a short break from her weeklong engagements to visit this historical site. Assuming Mayaâs perplexity, Lisa tried to demystify the astronomical instruments to Maya but soon found herself explaining in layman terms the fundamentals of physics â units and dimensions. Maya who had never encountered a foreigner in the past was excited to have had this opportunity and in turn tried hard to impress Lisa with her knowledge of elementary school mathematics. Back at school, Maya was an average student but she had developed the ability recall her lessons from memory.   She had been memorizing multiplication tables, equations and formulas. Rote learning is very common in India and children are often encouraged to memorize entire lessons to be able repro",0,3194,Medicine,Medicine/SciWrite/Fall2013,Comment,FALSE,FALSE,"{526f3f4e6d24a524f2000017=0.09882743182427617, 526f68f4fee3016e4400001a=0.09874048104109943, 526f93cc10ce3dcbbf000005=0.014652457151530929, 527c998782654f1783000016=0.10348540075819192, 52aa32400bd7ac01b9000004=0.018985262675541348}",first opinion is not the first comment / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion,0,4,52aa32400bd7ac01b9000004,0,32,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

If a threshold is set too low then it becomes meaningless--the 'prizes for all' culture common in British schools, for example--while if set too high it becomes unachievable and in either case ceases to be an incentive to greater effort.",0,480,Medicine,Medicine/SciWrite/Fall2013,Comment,FALSE,FALSE,"{528a431eea8a48e61c000002=0.1041885525445894, 528a673ff0fe4d04bf00000a=0.1806548294883851, 528aca397c5478be3200000b=0.02554690358177837, 528b1462f0fe4d684600000f=0.02858476528623566, 528b261bbc5f5a35a800000e=0.09857472790322308, 528b6686bc5f5a4ae100001a=0.021682571961952512, 528c46d8125cbba50a000010=0.01926205556371184, 528c4d3201f06cdf53000015=0.17937971872433242, 528c4db301f06ca3d000000f=0.09508893585268233, 528c5dd7125cbbd14500000f=0.17974946400250094, 528c875a64b6b8be41000017=0.17737098526850348, 528cbc062b2230bf5b000019=0.09634778352055151, 528cedea8cd9b1d61c000003=0.18401771382940985, 528d2c482c24d6c354000006=0.013199042280933678, 528da4accf41bd42d5000008=0.09930237181574417, 528dcde78cd9b1bd4500000b=0.09307135949224649, 528dd2b456bd92b71a000014=0.018072265215562665, 528de1662c24d61aa2000010=0.01191326017106861, 528decd156bd92269e000012=0.018290638744900944, 529011cbcb5ebe109200000a=0.1930853699015715, 52a2264aa377cf3550000005=0.028348964927913858}",more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion,1,4,529011cbcb5ebe109200000a,1,26,0,0,0,0.25,1,0,1,1,1

I too have this problem when hiking. As stated above:1) It is worse with a backpack (impaired venous return)2) It is worse in the heat (peripheral vasodilation leading to leakage into interstitial spaces)3) It is worse when my arms are still and hanging (no muscle pump action).  When you contract your muscles they push on the veins. The veins have one-way valves that then force the blood back to the heart. No contraction = no muscle pump = more blood pooling. The poles help because of muscle pump and less gravity to overcome the full length of your arms (just hooking your fingers in the straps of your backpack to bend your arms up will help too)4) It happens more the longer I am hiking in a particular day and the more tired I am (less venous tone). Over time, you lose the ability to constrict down vessels to the non-active tissue due to fatigue of the vessels. That will also increase blood pooling to those areas.Isn't it fun to think about why these things happen?  Next time you are hiking you can hold up your hand to your bud and explain.

You can read through the final questions when you get a little open time and answer any that are easy. There are some very straightforward, basic, and probably easy questions (eg. find a z-score). You can save the answers to any you answer so that you can review later. Just try a few whenever you get a chance. Make a note of anything you need to research. Return later. Second, there are only a few questions from Unit 9, and again, you can wait to answer those. Third, if you have handed in all of the HW, and if you have had similar scores on each, then HW 9 may have no meaningful effect on your HW average and thus your semester result. That means it may be more sensible to concentrate on the final more than the HW.In the end, my impression is that the final was easier than the HW. For one thing, everything was multiple choice, so on numerical questions, the choices provided some hint as to if you were proceeding correctly. Also, when I first saw the every question is individually submitted'''' style, it struck me as looking very tedious. In the end, I liked it. I was able to remove questions that I was very confident of from the list by submitting them. This made me feel better as I inched towards 60% and also inched towards completeing the exam. In the end, I finished the final first and turned in the HW today. Again, I found the HW was much harder than the final.I also thought of something. In school, it is often the case that the final exam must be taken very soon after the last day of instruction and also perhaps on the same day as another final. That certainly isn't ideal from a preparation standpoint. In the end, I'm not sure that the schedule for the final and HW9 was that big of a deal for many students. I generally avoid direct advice about telling people to change their study habits, but I'm breaking my rule here. I think the final and HW9 will be easier to complete if you alter any ridgid HW schedule you've been using. Work on the final at least while you're doing HW9. Get a decent first draft of HW 9 completed and then concentrate on the final. Don't get too invested i''''",2,578,Medicine,Medicine/HRP258/Statistics_in_Medicine,Comment,FALSE,FALSE,"{51feb922f09ff90e00000048=0.26031342590818524, 51fedec8f09ff90e00000060=0.10123285653813013, 51fedf7ff09ff90e00000061=0.18210151061719407, 51fee05cbd1a050a00000033=0.09580979305662737, 51ffaeadcc1dac0a00000010=0.26118000667211067, 51ffc17bcc1dac120000001d=0.09873890668224806, 52006a43ff03f00e0000005a=0.10456531539578184, 520445acd01fec0e00000022=0.17485287164002963, 520555646ca0be1200000030=0.02122125420064776, 5208e75c0757f11600000039=0.015379189387926215}",more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion,0,1,520445acd01fec0e00000022,0,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

I have been looking for a way to gain a better understanding of many aspects of statistics in medicine for many years. This course has been so much more helpful than trying to battle through a textbook. In particular, it has been a joy to finally be clear on which tests are used in which situations - something that can be so difficult to pick up from other sources. I particularly appreciated the information about the non-parametric tests as these are sometimes ignored and sidelined in other places whereas I come across them frequently in my work.To me, the course has been a rush as I had only about 3 weeks to get through it. But, it had been beyond my dreams that I would find something as good as this and so easily available - so I was determined to take advantage of it. It sounds like others may also have had some time pressures with it too. If so, perhaps a longer timeframe might be considered in future? Or at least a 'breather/catchup week' once or twice. Also, it may have been because of the rush and time pressure I was under, but I didn't understand for a while the iconography on the top bar that directs you from module to quiz to sometimes more modules and quizzes. I had no idea what the symbols were supposed to represent and just thought it was something that wasn't displaying properly on my screen and so ignored it - not discovering some of the material and some of the quizzes for quite a while. It would be helpful to have some text next to or on the icons so this is more obvious. I realize this may be just the template you have to work within and, if so, perhaps an instruction to bring our attention to this at the end of the first module might help. (Apologies if there was one and I missed it in my rush. But I read of at least one other person who missed the quizzes completely, presumably for the same reason.)Thank you once again.

But peer grading requires respect and patience. We are grading on the writing NOT on the topic. I don't think anyone can simply put a 0 to peer's essay just because you're not interested in the topic. Everyone of us know that it's hard to understand an scientific area when it's not your field. We are not know-it-all. But the peer grading needs your patience, respect, and help to improve another person's many hours essay.You can absolutely tell how the writer's work look like if you really spend your time on reading it.

However, Stanford isn't the same type of organizationGood post, Michaela. One of the directions of some MOOCs is towards this. MOOCs are ideal for bridge courses and prerequisites necessary for a taking a regular university course. This way, the teaching staff can focus on higher value courses and research.Still, it isn't fair on my part to compare MOOCs with regular classroom courses. Distance education using postal services has been around in many countries for several decades. Two decades ago, interactive livecast of classrooms to satellite campuses were popular in the US. This approach then carried over to the Internet in the mid 90s. Many of these remote'''' courses were also recognized, and contributed to a degree. Most courses had a fee. MOOCs are an extension of that. They have come a long way since 1999 when MIT placed its entire academic courseware online at ocw.mit.edu, totally free of cost. They changed the game. Last year MIT and Stanford teamed up and invested to launch Venture Lab (now NovoEd). There are some amazing MOOCs there, two of which I am currently taking. Most are free. https://novoed.com/(sorry for going OT)''''",0,169,Medicine,Medicine/SciWrite/Fall2013,Comment,FALSE,FALSE,"{527e0a94a748b6dd96000004=0.012928174696475642, 527e545f1bd3699c5a000009=0.014216156340631439, 527e60dda748b6474500000a=0.01683769240670283, 527ee185a748b64745000011=0.012021843404587063, 5280b7893bb45aa162000001=0.09396306666934086, 528181f734ce3ac6e100000e=0.008584379549181904, 5281f69434ce3a3b0c000010=0.015202740780990933, 52821871910619f7d1000005=0.012836118812107885}",more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion / more than one opinion,1,2,5280b7893bb45aa162000001,1,8,0,0,0,0.5,1,0,1,1,1

You could then take a particular temperature, $T$, and plug it into the equation to get a prediction or the probability that someone would buy and ice-cream at that temperature. You'd expect $hat eta_1$ to be positive, meaning that as $T$ increased, it would increase the probability of buying an ice-cream.  In the end, at the given temperature, $T$, the person either buys an ice-cream ($B=1$) or they do not ($B=0$).  But this may not be completely predictable so the most we can say is that there is some probability, $hat{mathrm{Prob}}(B=1)$, that the person will buy ice-cream at that temperature.  If the model is working well, that probability will be close to the proportion of days of that temperature that the person buys ice-cream.  > in any case, what is the assumed distribution of the > predictors?

Unfortunately, assistant professors need publications, and doctoral students need dissertation topics--to manage their own stress. So, what shows up are hundreds of one-time studies with crummy control groups, no data on effect size, no reports of ''''intention to treat'''' drop-out rates and, most concerning of all, follow-up data that rarely or never exceeds 30, 60 or 90 days. The QR response (Stroebel's offshoot of Benson's work), TM (multitudes of teachers), mindfulness meditation (in any of its forms), prayer (choose your object), and dozens of other ''''tools'''' have a physiological effect: when practiced assiduously and if applied consistently: an ''''if'''' that eliminates the majority of would-be practitioners. Most people don't bother with those techniques. They just muddle through. And, muddling through is probably about as effective a technique for most people as spending a bunch of time/money learning one of the ''''tools'''' suggested in the module. Certainly, that's what Dr. Friedlander did for both her speech and her sky-dive. That is, muddling works best unless you're going to use a specific ''''tool'''' to tolerate a very delimited stressor, and you are willing to put in as much time as necessary to get to a point where you can use that ''''tool'''' one time for that one event. After that, you might just as well just try repeating the event, and seeing how you do the 2nd time. It probably will go better the next time without a lot of extra ''''tools.''''So, I again suggest sticking with understanding the physiology, practicing the situation that you need to become competent at, and ignoring the benedictions of stress-management ''''tool'''' promoters. Once you understand the physiology you can devise your own way of getting by. That will almost certainly be far more effective than anything someone gives you to try. ----Generalization effects in coping skills training.Smith, Ronald E.Journal of Sport & Exercise Psychology, Vol 21(3), Sep 1999, 189-204.AbstractAn important consideration in coping skills training is the extent to which acquired skills generalize to other life domains.

I'm breathing slowly and deeply, but I still feel frustrated. You've got a module that spends too much time pontificating about some quasi-useful distress reduction techniques (yes, there is a difference between stress and distress, so why not use the appropriate terminology, rather than the good''''/''''bad'''' dichotomy?), when you could have stuck to some really nice, tight physiological information. In that regard, why ignore the enteric nervous system entirely? I'm also frustrated (yes, I'm still breathing slowly and regularly) over the fact that you have a couple of exercise physiologists who aren't promoting the use of activity and repetitive task-rehearsal (i.e., practice) as the most effective ways of modulating physiological arousal. Take, for example, the fact that you use sky-diving and public-speaking as stress-inducing exemplars: but, you show no use in those situations of the ''''tools'''' you endorse, nor any evidence that those ''''tools'''' alter the physiological responses to such situations. If you're going to bother gathering cortisol and catecholamine levels, or even the simpler EDR values, why not show changes in those indices with application of your ''''tools''''? Well, the reason probably is that you'd see no difference in the physiological profile with and w/o those ''''tools.'''' Most of these techniques offer little more than mental health mumbo-jumbo, at least as attempted by motivated people. There is little or no generalization of those ''''tools'''' to daily life, and what effect is seen is small and unreliable. If they did work, wouldn't we have seen the effects with Dr. Friedlander? On the other hand, suppose that Dr. Friedlander did several speeches a semester? Repetition would reduce the physiological response. This explains why I put ''''tools'''' in quotes, and why this module is both disappointing and frustrating. You guys do a GREAT job when you stick to teaching physiology! IMO, though, your batting average is a big whiff when you switch over to life-coaching. Not because you are bad teachers (you aren't: you're quite effective), but because you have stepped outside your proficiencies into fields (clinical psychology, life-coaching, counseling) that are mired in myth, magical thinking, and quasi-scientific jargon.''''",1,283,Humanities,HumanitiesSciences/EP101/Environmental_Physiology,CommentThread,FALSE,FALSE,"{52f57588610ff741a2000058=0.41947160508485043, 52f7cdb72365ecf614000041=0.4191996938140303, 52f844e52365ecf614000071=0.4195919027546034}",first opinion is not the first comment / more than one opinion / more than one opinion,0,1,52f844e52365ecf614000071,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

Unfortunately, information alone contributes only a small percentage to behavior change, so an educational campaign won't solve the problem.  It is a very complex issue that has many, many layers.  People have been approaching it from many angles with limited success: education, changing the physical environment to facilitate movement (smart growth, stairs vs elevators), trying to get healthier foods into low income areas known as food deserts'''', banning sugared sodas from schools, limiting portion sizes, giving health care insurance incentives for gym memberships, creating more movement based video games, etc., etc., etc..  Unfortunately, our bodies are programmed to store fat for times of food scarcity which doesn't happen much for most of us these days.  Junk food which is cheap, calorically dense and readily available is hard to resist because it is engineered to push our ''''craving buttons''''.  I'm not saying that motivation and will power don't have a role in the problem, but it is definitely not the only factor.  Those of us who are highly educated with good access to healthy food and exercising opportunities AND a genetic profile that makes weight balance easier, should be careful not to judge others in this area.  It is true that people need to take personal responsibility for their own health, but the choices are easier for some of us than others.  Try to be compassionate. Let's try to figure out creative ways to help address the problem rather than pointing fingers. With strong people like you on the job, we will surely find a way to solve the problem together.

But in the lecture it is claimed, that the least squares model is even undefined for p>N. And the book (Intro to Stat Learning, 6.1.2, page 208) alternatively claims that least squares of any model with p>=N will not yield a unique solution. I've done a fair share of online searching and browsed through the Elements of Stat Learning but don't seem to get it.

However, my understanding is that you only see a decrease in SV with increasing HR at the higher end of the heart rate range.  If you look at SV over the course of a graded exercise test (of increasing intensity), there is generally an increase to about 50 percent of max HR. Then depending on training status, type of exercise, etc, you either get a flattening out of the curve or maybe even a decrease at the high ends.  As you may know, it is not an easy measure to get accurately in humans.  The bottom line is that cardiac output is thought to go up at first because of both HR and SV and then eventually HR only.

I have them pick a few songs that they like on the ipod or cd and I have them turn the sound down so they can hear the music but can't make out what the singer is saying. They relax and focus on the singer. After a while they can hear the singer very well and all of the focus is on the song and away from the stresser. The technique has been very useful with athletes that are too nervous. The only draw back is that with the improved focus on the song you might hear all the imperfections of the singer and no longer like that singer or song.

So, beta regression or nonlinear regression are good things to try.  But, personally, I'd probably start with something simpler than either of those.  It's hard to say without looking at the data and knowing the intended goals of the model, but in general I'd probably suggest tranforming the response and using standard models like linear regression, splines, lasso, whatever, on the transformed response.  So, for example, if it really is bounded on an open interval, you can shift and scale the response until it's bounded on (0,1) and the do a logit transform. The transformed response will then be unbounded and the standard models may apply.  Of course, if those models don't fit well (e.g., examine the residuals), then you'll need to try something else.  For example, you may want to look at folded power transforms for a series of transforms that may work better than logit.  If that doesn't work, then try more complicated approaches.Hope that helps.",1,426,Humanities,HumanitiesScience/StatLearning/Winter2014,Comment,FALSE,FALSE,{530bcf0ad964888c1000003d=0.017453908278187342},first opinion is not the first comment,0,1,530bcf0ad964888c1000003d,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1

You may be using CV the wrong way (and not know it). As explained in lecture, if you have 1,000 variables and pre-screen them using bi-variate correlations between each x and y, then your CV estimate of test set error may be overly optimistic. 2. The right way to use CV would be to include variable pre-screening at each fold. However, if you have a large data set, doing CV the right way might be computationally intensive. For example, if you do 10-fold CV with 1 MM observations, you're pre-screening the variables 10 times where **each** iteration would use 900,000 observations to pre-screen 1,000 variables. If you had a 70% training/30% test splilt, you would prescreen the variables once on 700,000 training observations.3. If you use CV to estimate tuning parameters **and** use CV to estimate test set error, your CV test set error may be overly optimistic. I often use CV to choose tuning parameters, but use a test set to estimate test set error.4. Comparing CV test set errors between two models (e.g., lasso vs. trees) may be problematic unless you correctly set the seed values. By default, 10-fold CV randomly assigns an observation to one fold. If you run 10-fold CV repeatedly, an observation might end up in different folds. For example, you run cv.glmnet(), observation 1 might be in fold 9. If you run cv.tree() observation 1 might be in fold 10. The CV test set errors are not comparable because the compositions of the folds are different! You can avoid this (I think) by setting the same seed value right before running each cv function.",2,147,Humanities,HumanitiesScience/StatLearning/Winter2014,Comment,FALSE,FALSE,{531b2ddec89646fa28000007=0.04255854006552307},first opinion is not the first comment,1,1,531b2ddec89646fa28000007,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

I have two questions about that:1) Wouldn't it be better to eventually fit the model to the whole dataset and use that model instead of the model fitted on the trainingset only? For this model the test error (evaluated on the testset) probably gives a conservative estimate of the test error for the model fitted on the whole dataset.2) Isn't cross-validation always superior as this would give a more stable estimate of test error (not depending on one random split)? Even if you have a large dataset, as you are fitting more and more complex models, the effective size of the dataset decreases and it would be wasteful to set aside some part of the data: With crossvalidation you would be better able to tease out complex patterns in the data than with the hold-out method.Any opinions on this?",1,147,Humanities,HumanitiesScience/StatLearning/Winter2014,CommentThread,FALSE,FALSE,{531b2ddec89646fa28000007=0.032143927238546983},first opinion is not the first comment,1,1,531b2ddec89646fa28000007,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

With the CI all people are followed for the same amount of time. For example, say you had 40 people in a STATS class and a 1-year period. 14 of these students developed pneumonia. The 1-year cumulative incidence of pneumonia (14/40) or (14/40)*100 = 35 per 100 students. A CI value has no units and the denominator is based on all people who are at risk at risk in the population. It assumes that all people are followed for the same amount of time (in this case a year), and that the population is closed (no people going in or out). Incidence rate (also called incidence density) = # of incident cases / Amount of person time at risk. The best way to think of it is as the occurrence of new cases (of a particular outcome) that arise during a certain amount of person-time of observation. The numerator for CI and incidence rate are exactly the same. The difference is that incidence rate is a true rate because it includes time. In order to understand incidence rate, one needs to talk about person-time. Person-time is only counted up until a person is diagnosed with the outcome of interest. For incidence rate, there is no assumption that everyone is followed for the same amount of time. People can exit and enter the population. So say a person is in a study for 6 months, without getting the outcome, and then drops out - they contribute 6 months to the person time of observation in the candidate population. Say a person is in the study for 12 months, without getting the outcome, and then dies - they contribute 12 months to the person time of observation in the candidate population. Say a person is in the study for 6 months and then gets diagnosed with the outcome of interest - they contribute 6 months to the person time of observation in the candidate population. If these were the only 3 people in the study, the incidence rate would be 1 / 2person-years. The numerator is 1 because 1 person had the outcome and the denominator of the incidence rate is the sum of all the person-times from each member in the candidate population (the population at risk).",3,129,Medicine,Medicine/MedStats/Summer2014,Comment,FALSE,FALSE,{53b5db0b7814629e2200005d=0.027719633757498027},first opinion is not the first comment,0,1,53b5db0b7814629e2200005d,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1

Furthermore, the 0 and 1's look like outliers? The median is the value that lies at the midpoint. In this example, the ''''bulk'''' of data occurs in the right portion. The ''''tail'''' extends to the left and contains extremely small values. These small values will pull the mean of the distribution towards the values located at the tail. When you have these extremely small values on the left (separated from the bulk of the data), it creates a tail. (Try drawing a picture of this or looking online). In this example, the outliers create a tail on the left side of the distribution - So it is a left tail.OR do not naturally follow a normal distribution, they have right skew. Ratio's cannot have values below zero (Try to come up with a negative ratio!). You get all kinds of values that are close to zero, but you cannot go below zero. So there is a boundary! OR can be any positive value - there is no bound on the right hand side.

Let me try explaining both of your questions with one example!As you may have seen in the lectures, a distribution is skewed if one tail is longer than the other (there is a lack of symmetry). With a right skew (also called positive), the bulk (or mass) of the data is on the left and there is a tail extending to the right with extreme values. (Go to google and look a pictures of right skewed data). Do you remember learning about odds ratios? You may remember that Dr. <redacted> mentioned that the sampling distribution of the OR is skewed to the right? If you think about how ORs are calculated and what they mean, it is clear that you cannot have negative values. (A negative OR does not make any sense!). With a limit at the lower end (zero is the limit since it cannot be negative), you get a skewed distribution. An OR can be any positive value from 0 to infinity. With large values on the right...you have right skewed data. So what can you do to ***Transform*** this data to deal with the fact that the distribution is skewed? What happens when you take the log of a negative number (try it on a calculator)?What happens when you take the log of a decimal <1 (for example try 0.5 on a calculator)?What happens when you take the log of 1? (try it on a calculator)?WHat happens when you take the log of 1000? (try it on a calculator)?When you transform data, you replace the variables by a function of the original variable. In many cases, this can change the shape of the distribution. Notice how the log of a large number is a lot smaller (for 1000 you get 6.91)? A logarithmic transformation reduces positive skewness by compressing the right end of the tail and extending the left/lower end. Why does this work?Try ln(1)-ln(.1) = on your calculator...Try ln(10) - ln(1) = on your calculator ...Try ln(1000) - ln(10) = on your calculator...What do you notice? The distance between all of these are the same when you use the log scale! So why use log transformations?Summary: the logarithm can move larger values closer together and smaller values farther apart...which can help with skewed distributions!best,Josh",3,95,Medicine,Medicine/MedStats/Summer2014,Comment,FALSE,FALSE,{53cf4696bd7f4bc4c200000e=0.10441463708137363},first opinion is not the first comment,0,2,53cf4696bd7f4bc4c200000e,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1

However, when you take a sample mean from a sample n, that mean will ALWAYS fall within the values of your sample. You will ALWAYS get a value that is within the range of values that you have sampled. You could have a sample/calculated sample mean and have a situation where the actual population mean falls outside of your sample data. So when you are calculating the sample variance and squaring distances from your SAMPLE mean, you are more likely to get a much lower estimate than the true variance from the actual population mean. This means you are likely to be underestimating the true population variance. Using n-1 provides a better estimate!When you divide by n-1 you divide by a smaller number than n. When you divide by smaller numbers, you get larger values, right? So you are less likely to underestimate!Best,Josh",1,46,Medicine,Medicine/MedStats/Summer2014,Comment,FALSE,FALSE,{53d6ed7481ef0ab134000037=0.10363299925980506},first opinion is not the first comment,1,2,53d6ed7481ef0ab134000037,1,4,0,0,0,0.5,0,1,1,1,1

This is not surprising. But then they broke runners into quintiles by different running characteristics (such as total time run, speed, and distance run). The Hazard Ratios appeared similar across the different quintiles of running activity. So, they concluded that running a little is just as good as running a lot. The headlines come from the fact that the lowest quintiles included people running <51 min per week (7 minutes per day), <6 miles , and 1 to 2 times per week. There are of course a lot of caveats! (1) When we break data into quintiles, the sample sizes in each quintile are much smaller than the sample size in the overall study. So chance may play a role. (2) People who run 51 minutes per week are probably not running 5-10 minutes per day: they are probably running 1-2 longer runs of several miles. If you are able to run several miles at once, you are probably reasonably fit and may have been running more than this at other times in your life. (3) People who run a small amount may be participating in many other physical activities: though the authors adjusted for this, it was a very crude adjustment.

I found the study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology and read if carefully. I did this because the headlines don't sound right to me. Also, I wanted to practice some of the skills we have been acquiring in this class.Definitely, this is an observational study so it is incorrect to say that running any amount of time is 'causing' the reductions in adverse outcomes, but the study authors themselves are using the 'as little as five minutes a day' line.This bothers me a lot. <zipRedac>) I don't think that the questionnaire asked people how many minutes they ran on a given day, but how much they ran in the past 3 months. 2) Most of the analysis compares all running groups to the non running groups and 3) multiple subgroup analysis are done.  I did not notice any alpha corrections for multiple tests.I also want to know 45 and 30% more than what number exactly (this may have been a healthy group of college educated white folks)?  I found two numbers in the text, Dr. <redacted>, otherwise most of the statistics are hazard ratios.  The numbers I found were 34<zipRedac>3 all cause deaths during the study period and <zipRedac>2<zipRedac>7 CVD deaths.  To find the number of events in each group, runners vs non, is it simply a multiplication problem?
